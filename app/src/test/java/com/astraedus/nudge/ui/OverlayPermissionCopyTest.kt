/**
 * Source-level copy gate on the "Display Over Other Apps" / "Overlay Permission" rows in
 * onboarding and Settings.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 * SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW draws the block screen, but it does a second, much less visible job: a
 * granted overlay permission helps `NudgeMonitorService` restart itself when
 * `ProtectionWatchdogWorker` finds it dead, because Android 12+ refuses to start a foreground
 * service from the background at all without it — see
 * `docs/architecture/service-lifecycle-and-watchdog.md`, "Real start paths for the foreground
 * service". Both onboarding and Settings described only the first job ("shows block screens") and
 * let the user skip the permission with no idea that doing so also makes it more likely the app
 * cannot heal itself overnight. That is the same shape of defect issue #23 already burned a Play
 * review on: a failure mode invisible to the user until blocking has already quietly stopped.
 *
 * Deliberately worded as "helps" / "more likely", never "guarantees" / "always" or "never": Android
 * 16 (API 36) narrowed the overlay exemption background restarts rely on, so even a granted
 * permission is not a hard guarantee on every OS version. Opening Nudge yourself is the one thing
 * that reliably restarts it regardless of Android version, which both screens' copy says.
 *
 * ## Why a source-grep test, not a Compose UI test
 * Both screens are large, hand-styled Composables with no test tags on this copy, and Settings'
 * description is a plain conditional expression, not a resource lookup — there is nothing here a
 * Robolectric or instrumented render would check more cheaply than reading the literal string. This
 * follows the same shape as `ProtectionAlertCopyTest` (service copy) and `MonitorServiceContractTest`
 * (service shape): assert on the properties of the real source text.
 *
 * ## Counterfactual (run manually, not by CI)
 * Deleting the "helps Nudge restart its own protection" sentence from `OnboardingScreen.kt`, or
 * deleting the `if (overlayEnabled) { ... } else { ... }` cost branches from `SettingsScreen.kt` in
 * favor of the old static "Required to show block screens" string, makes this test fail — confirmed
 * by hand, twice (once for the original wording, again after this copy was softened to drop the
 * "guarantees a restart" overclaim): both sentences were removed, the corresponding
 * `mentions ... restart cost` / `is sharper when ... not granted` test failed with the expected
 * assertion message on both screens, and the text was restored. A future editor who trims this copy
 * back to "just describes the overlay" will hit that same failure, which is the point: the cost
 * sentence is load-bearing, not decoration.
